# Minimizing the Use of External Libraries in Projects

I have always strived to minimize the use of external libraries in my projects and build those components myself.

## Approach

In my development process, I prioritize building custom components over relying on third-party libraries. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Control**: By building components from scratch, I have full control over their functionality, appearance, and integration with the project.
- **Performance**: Custom-built components are often optimized for the specific needs of the project, leading to better performance compared to generic solutions provided by external libraries.
- **Flexibility**: Building components myself allows for greater flexibility in adapting them to project requirements and making changes as needed.
- **Learning Experience**: Developing custom components provides valuable learning opportunities and helps deepen my understanding of programming concepts and best practices.

## Benefits

While utilizing external libraries can expedite development and offer ready-made solutions for common tasks, I believe that the benefits of building custom components outweigh the convenience of using third-party dependencies.

By adhering to this approach, I ensure that my projects remain lean, maintainable, and tailored to their specific requirements.


## TODOs for Further Features

Here are some additional features I plan to implement in future iterations of my projects:

- **Improved Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support for a more inclusive user experience.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implement support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
- **Data Persistence**: Introduce data persistence mechanisms such as local storage or server-side databases for storing user preferences and data.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide better feedback to users and improve fault tolerance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize the performance of the application by identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, my preference for building custom components reflects my commitment to craftsmanship, performance optimization, and continuous learning in software development.
